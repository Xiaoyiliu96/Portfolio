        <p>Masks protect against COVID-19 but not environmental pollution.
Humans want to breathe air without masks, and the planet wants to breathe air without masks.
A COVID-19 vaccine doesn't mean we won't get COVID-19.
Impact of COVID-19.
Under COVID-19, not only humans but also animals and the planet are affected.</p>

        <p>Choose a short word and recreate it as a three-dimensional, typographic, sculptural object that lends visual meaning to the word: place your emphasis on visual clarity and base your word’s design upon an existing, classic typeface (think Baskerville, Didot, Helvetica, Rockwell). Visual tone—that unifies your word and typeface—should be apparent within your type sculpture. You will then use photography or scanning techniques to capture the three-dimensional form as a two- dimensional image, which will become the key art for a poster. The image will be used for a call-to-action poster which showcases your word and a cultural / issue-driven message.</p>
        <p>Under COVID-19, people are wearing masks when they go out. COVID-19 has affected our lives, schools arrange for students and teachers to take online classes, restaurants only can take out, people avoid crowds, and sometimes we can't hear each other clearly when they wear masks. People's lives slowly returned to normal because of the COVID-19 vaccine made by relevant personnel. Even though we have been vaccinated against COVID-19, we still need to wear masks because people are vaccinated doesn't mean we won't get covid -19. People consume at least 1 mask or more per day. "The environmental toll of disposable masks" published by MIT News says that the COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to generate up to 7,200 tons of medical waste daily, much of which is disposable masks. When will COVID-19 end? We don't know yet, but we can rely on masks and vaccines to protect us from infection. What about the earth? People consume one or more masks every day, and people create mask pollution every day, which is increasing the burden on the earth. Under COVID-19, not only humans but also animals and the planet are affected. While people are quarantined at home due to COVID-19, we are seeing videos of animals bravely taking to the streets without humans because of the absence of humans. Therefore, COVID-19 may be trying to tell humans that we should do more to reduce environmental pollution and protection of animals.</p>
